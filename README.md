# NACA Wing Generator for Ground Effect Vehicles

This initial project aims to develop a Python program that generates .SLT files of NACA wings for use in ground effect vehicles (GEVs). The program allows the user to input NACA codes, dimensions, attack angle, and washout factor to generate a 3D model of the wing. The software is flexible enough to work with various GEV designs and provides the user with the option to customise the design parameters to optimise the wing for specific applications. To achieve this the tool incorporates its own machine learning algorithms designed to react to the results of simulated tests.

While the purpose of this project is to provide an efficient and easy-to-use tool for GEV designers to generate wings that are optimised for their specific needs the tool itself is agnostic as to the purpose of the design. By providing a flexible software solution, we aim to empower GEV designers to create better-performing vehicles that can take advantage of the ground effect phenomenon.

## Features

- NACA code input
- Wing dimensions customization
- Attack angle adjustment
- Washout factor customization
- 3D model generation
- Optimization capabilities

## Installation

1. Clone the repository from GitHub when it is provided.
2. Install the required dependencies.
3. Run the Python program and input the desired parameters to generate a wing model.

## Usage

The program is easy to use and intuitive. To generate a wing model, the user inputs the desired NACA code, dimensions, attack angle, and washout factor. The software then generates a 3D model of the wing.
